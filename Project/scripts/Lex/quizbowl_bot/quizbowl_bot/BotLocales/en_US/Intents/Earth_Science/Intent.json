In addition to olivine, an ortho- one, one variety of a group of these was the source of the first rubidium to be discovered, while another is best known for its perfect basal cleavage and the thin sheet into which is breaks: those varieties are known as lepidolite and muscovite. Their best "}, {"utterance": "These devices are characterized by a magnification coefficient that appears in the indicator equation characterizing the instrument response.Most modern examples of them use force feedback and employ Galitzin's innovation of using a transducer to couple to a galvanometer. The reduced response of Galitzin systems was a critical factor in developing the Sprengnether and Benioff variants of these instruments. The Wood-Anderson torsion variant is used in defining a popular magnitude scale."}, {"utterance": "Optical properties of this mineral include a change from biaxial positive to negative when its most common cation makes up 85% of its total cationic sum, and Poldervaart provided the most popular diagram for estimation of this mineral's composition based on birefringence and 2V, though optical geochemistry estimations often fail due to its compositional zonation. Conchoidal fracturing provides a route for its alteration to iddingsite, and its alpha form changes to wadsleyite and ringwo"}, {"utterance": "Series of these found in U-shaped valleys are known as Paternoster ones. Other types include holomictic and endoheic, which have little intermixing between layers, known as thermoclines, and no significant discharge, respectively. Those produced by scouring are called tarns. Vostok is the largest one in Antarctica. Long Island's Ronkonkoma resulted from glacial calving and is thus the kettle type. Oxbow ones are formed when a meander is cut off from a stream and artificial ones are oft"}, {"utterance": "One mechanism explaining their formation is the \"hot tower\" hypothesis of Simpson and Riehl. Kerry Cook of Cornell has famously used GCM simulations to show how they are affected by continental surfaces. In the southern Pacific their theory must be modified due to the Walker circulation between the waters of South America and Australia. They draw warm, moist air into the intertropical convergence zone and follow the \"thermal equator\" of highest temperature.

According to Petterssen's Rule, they serve as ideal generators for mid-latitude cyclones. Long trails of altocumulus clouds commonly occur in their presence, resulting in prolonged periods of precipitation. They may develop from inverted troughs, or when southward flowing polar air slows against a ridge of high pressure, leading to parallel but opposing wind dir"}, {"utterance": "Returning from Greenland, he accepted a post as tutor at the University of Marburg.  While browsing in the university library, he came across a scientific paper that listed fossils of identical plants and animals found on opposite sides of the Atlantic.  Also, he noticed the close fit between the coastlines of Africa and South America and wondered if the similarities among organisms are due, not to land bridges, but to the continents having been joined together at one time.

It was discovered by Lehmann, who recognized weak arrivals in the P wave shadow zone. It is slowly growing by incongruent freezing at its surface, providing chemical buoyancy and energy for driving the geodynamo in the layer above it.
