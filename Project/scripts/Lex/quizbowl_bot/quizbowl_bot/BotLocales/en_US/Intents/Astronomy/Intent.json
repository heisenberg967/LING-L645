Edward Pickering discovered a namesake series of spectral lines in these objects that were later attributed to helium.

They show absorption features from titanium oxide and technetium, implying convective mixing in a dredge-up phase associated with their thermal pulses. They are initially supported by hydrogen shell burning before evolving onto the horizontal branch following the helium flash. The final thermal pulse of one of these objects can blow off a planetary nebula and leave a remnant white dwarf, "}, {"utterance": "In analyzing 31 flybys of this body in 1996, scientist found gravitational anomalies in one, providing evidence for its lumpy interior, while NIMS detected such ocean salts as magnesium sulfate here in 2000, supporting the theory of an ocean deep below its surface.

These are the primaries in cataclysmic variables, where they will often emit soft radiation.
