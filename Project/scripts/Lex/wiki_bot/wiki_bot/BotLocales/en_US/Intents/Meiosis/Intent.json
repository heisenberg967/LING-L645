{"utterance": "Meiosis () is a special type of cell division necessary for sexual reproduction in eukaryotes ."}, {"utterance": "The cells produced by meiosis are gametes or spores ."}, {"utterance": "In many organisms, including all animals and land plants (but not some other groups such as fungi ), gametes are called sperm and egg cells ."}, {"utterance": "Whilst the process of meiosis bears a number of similarities with the 'life-cycle' cell division process of mitosis , it differs in two important respects:"}, {"utterance": "the chromosomes in meiosis undergo a recombination which shuffles the genes producing a different genetic combination in each gamete, compared with the co-existence of each of the two separate pairs of each chromosome (one received from each parent) in each cell which results from mitosis."}, {"utterance": "the outcome of meiosis is potentially four (genetically unique) haploid cells, compared with the two (genetically identical) diploid cells produced from mitosis."}, {"utterance": "Meiosis begins with one diploid cell containing two copies of each chromosome \u2014one from the organism's mother and one from its father."}, {"utterance": "The cell divides twice, potentially producing up to four haploid cells containing one copy of each chromosome."}, {"utterance": "(\"Potentially\" because in some cases, such as the formation of oocytes in mammals, only one of the possible four haploid cells survives.)"}, {"utterance": "In animals the haploid cell resulting from meiosis is a male or female gamete ."}, {"utterance": "Each of the resulting chromosomes in the gamete cells is a unique mixture of maternal and paternal DNA, resulting in offspring that are genetically distinct from either parent."}, {"utterance": "This gives rise to genetic diversity in sexually reproducing populations."}, {"utterance": "This genetic diversity can provide the variation of physical and behavioural attributes ( phenotypes ) upon which natural selection can act, but, as described below in Section 6, Origin and function of meiosis, the genetic diversity may be largely a by-product of the homologous recombination that is primarily employed for its DNA repair function during meiosis."}, {"utterance": "It is also noteworthy that during meiosis, specific genes are more highly transcribed, and these are called the meiome, the term used in functional genomics for the meiotic transcriptome ."}, {"utterance": "Meiosis is a key feature for all sexually reproducing eukaryotes in which homologous chromosome pairing, synapse and recombination occur."}, {"utterance": "In addition to strong meiotic stage-specific expression of mRNA (the meiome), however, there are also pervasive translational controls (e.g. selective usage of preformed mRNA), regulating the ultimate meiotic stage-specific protein expression of genes during meiosis."}, {"utterance": "Thus, both the meiome and translational controls determine the broad restructuring of meiotic cells needed to carry out meiosis."}, {"utterance": "Prior to the meiosis process the cell's chromosomes are duplicated by a round of DNA replication , creating from the maternal and paternal versions of each chromosome ( homologs ) two exact copies, sister chromatids , attached at the centromere region."}, {"utterance": "In the beginning of meiosis the maternal and paternal homologs pair to each other."}, {"utterance": "Then they typically exchange parts by homologous recombination leading to crossovers of DNA between the maternal and paternal versions of the chromosome."}, {"utterance": "Spindle fibers bind to the centromeres of each pair of homologs and arrange the pairs at the spindle equator."}, {"utterance": "Then the fibers pull the recombined homologs to opposite poles of the cell."}, {"utterance": "As the chromosomes move away from the center the cell divides into two daughter cells, each containing a haploid number of chromosomes composed of two chromatids."}], "intentConfirmationSetting": null, "intentClosingSetting": {"isActive": true, "closingResponse": {"allowInterrupt": true, "messageGroupsList": [{"message":
