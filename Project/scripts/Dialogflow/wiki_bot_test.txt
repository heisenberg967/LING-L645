By the end of the war, four major imperial powers—the German , Russian , Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires—ceased to exist.
The successor states of the former two lost a great amount of territory, while the latter two were dismantled entirely.
The map of central Europe was redrawn into several smaller states.
The League of Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict.
The European nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires, the repercussions of Germany's defeat and problems with the Treaty of Versailles are agreed to be factors contributing to World War II .
By the time of Augustus, cultured Greek household slaves taught the Roman young (sometimes even the girls); chefs, decorators, secretaries, doctors, and hairdressers—all came from the Greek East .
Greek sculptures adorned Hellenistic landscape gardening on the Palatine or in the villas , or were imitated in Roman sculpture yards by Greek slaves.
The Roman cuisine preserved in the cookery books ascribed to Apicius is essentially Greek.
Roman writers disdained Latin for a cultured Greek style.
Only in law and governance was the Italic nature of Rome's accretive culture supreme.
Against this human background, both the urban and rural setting, one of history's most influential civilizations took shape, leaving behind a cultural legacy that survives in part today.
One was due to open in Monterrey, Mexico , in 1995 but due to her death it was not opened.
Around 1999 the San Antonio location closed and the Corpus Christi location was closed in 2009.
In late 1990s some European retail traders developed the idea of tailoring a shop towards a lifestyle theme, in the form of "concept stores", which specialised in cross-selling without using separate departments.
One of the first concept stores was 10 Corso Como in Milan, Italy followed by Colette in Paris and Quartier 206 in Berlin.
Several well-known American chains such as Urban Outfitters , D-A-S-H , and The Gap , Australian chain Billabong and, though less common, Lord & Taylor adapted to the concept store trend after 2000.

Many major passenger ships have docked there, including the RMS Queen Mary 2 and Freedom of the Seas , before the Brooklyn and Bayonne terminals opened.
The SS Normandie caught fire and subsequently capsized at its Pier 88 berth during World War II .
The Normandie, renamed USS Lafayette, lies capsized in the frozen mud at Pier 88 in the winter of 1942
Norwegian Cruise Line 's soon to be newest ship the Norwegian Breakaway will sail year-round out of the New York Passenger Ship Terminal.
The city will spend $4 million to renovate and upgrade the cruise terminal to accommodate the ship.
This decay is called spontaneous fission .
This decay happens when a large unstable nucleus spontaneously splits into two (and occasionally three) smaller daughter nuclei, and usually emits gamma rays, neutrons, or other particles as a consequence.
Radioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e., random) process at the level of single atoms, in that, according to quantum theory , it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay.
However, the chance that a given atom will decay is constant over time.
For a large number of atoms, the decay rate for the collection is computable from the measured decay constants of the nuclides (or equivalently from the half-lifes ).
He was active in community affairs, colonial and state politics, as well as national and international affairs.
From 1785 to 1788, he served as governor of Pennsylvania .
Toward the end of his life, he freed his slaves and became one of the most prominent abolitionists .
His colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, have seen Franklin honored on coinage and money ; warships ; the names of many towns , counties, educational institutions, namesakes, and companies; and more than two centuries after his death, countless cultural references.
A famous landmark in the Solar System , Jupiter 's Great Red Spot , is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years.
However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies.
A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System.
The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind .
They were helped by an outpouring of public sympathy and charitable donations.
Some of the male survivors were accused of cowardice for leaving the ship while people were still on board; the White Star Line's chairman, J. Bruce Ismay , faced social ostracism for the rest of his life.
The wreck of the Titanic remains on the seabed, split in two and gradually disintegrating at a depth of .
Since its discovery in 1985, thousands of artefacts have been recovered and put on display at museums around the world.
Titanic has become one of the most famous ships in history, her memory kept alive by numerous books, folk songs, films, exhibits, and memorials .
In 1902, the First National Bank of Porto Rico issued banknotes in a parallel manner.
Two more series were issued until 1913.
After Puerto Rico's economy and monetary system was fully integrated into the United States' economic and monetary system, the Puerto Rican dollars were redeemed for those issued by the United States Treasury .
The peso and dollar have been followed by other contemporary issues, including commemorative banknotes, private currency, and a quarter coin designed with Fort San Felipe del Morro in the face.
Many such laws apply also to motorcycling, boating , piloting aircraft, use of motile farm equipment such as tractors and combines, riding horses or driving a horse-drawn vehicle, or bicycling, possibly with different BAC level than driving.
In some jurisdictions there are separate charges depending on the vehicle used, such as BWI (bicycling while intoxicated), which may carry a lighter sentence.
In the United States, local law enforcement agencies made 1,467,300 arrests nationwide for driving under the influence of alcohol in 1996, compared to 1.9 million such arrests during the peak year in 1983.
In 1997 an estimated 513,200 DWI offenders were in prison or jail , down from 593,000 in 1990 and up from 270,100 in 1986.
Estimates are that up to 200 dwarf planets may be found when the entire region known as the Kuiper belt is explored, and that the number may exceed 10,000 when objects scattered outside the Kuiper belt are considered.
Individual astronomers recognize several of these, and in August 2011 Mike Brown published a list of 390 candidate objects, ranging from "nearly certain" to "possible" dwarf planets.'
Brown identifies nine known objects – the five accepted by the IAU plus , , , and – as "virtually certain", with another two dozen highly likely, and there are probably a hundred or so such objects in total.
The classification of bodies in other planetary systems with the characteristics of dwarf planets has not been addressed.
Brasília has a unique status in Brazil, as it is an administrative division rather than a legal municipality like nearly all cities in Brazil .
Nationally, the term is almost always used synonymously with the Federal District, which constitutes an indivisible Federative Unit , analogous to a state.
Several "satellite cities" exist which are also part of the Federal District.
Brasília International Airport is the main airport in Brasília, connecting the capital to all major Brazilian cities and many international destinations.
It is the third most important airport in Brazil, in terms of passengers and aircraft movements.
The actions of the general Pausanias at the siege of Byzantium alienated many of the Greek states from the Spartans, and the anti-Persian alliance was therefore reconstituted around Athenian leadership, as the so-called Delian League .
The Delian League continued to campaign against Persia for the next three decades, beginning with the expulsion of the remaining Persian garrisons from Europe.
At the Battle of the Eurymedon in 466 BC, the League won a double victory that finally secured freedom for the cities of Ionia.
However, the League's involvement in an Egyptian revolt (from 460–454 BC) resulted in a disastrous defeat, and further campaigning was suspended.
A fleet was sent to Cyprus in 451 BC, but achieved little, and when it withdrew the Greco-Persian Wars drew to a quiet end.
Some historical sources suggest the end of hostilities was marked by a peace treaty between Athens and Persia, the so-called Peace of Callias .
As of the present, however, her years on the program tie Wapner at 12 seasons.
In the 2009-10 television season, The People's Courts 2nd/present life outlasted its first when it reached 13 seasons.
While the show taped in New York City for the first 15 seasons of its second life, it now tapes in Stamford, Connecticut as of the 2012-13 season.
On September 3, 2012, The People's Court's 2nd/present life entered its 16th season (28th overall season).
With 28 total seasons, The People's Court ranks as the 2nd longest-running courtroom program behind the ongoing Divorce Court at 33 seasons (from its 3 combined lives).
Tubes can be fragile, sometimes generate significant unwanted heat, and can take many seconds—many minutes in critical applications—after powering on to warm to a temperature where they perform within operational tolerance.
However, tubes still find uses where solid-state devices have not been developed, are impractical, or where a tube has superior performance, as with some devices in professional audio and high-power radio transmitters.
Tubes are still produced for such applications.
Tubes are less likely than semiconductor devices to be destroyed by the electromagnetic pulse produced by nuclear explosions and geomagnetic storms produced by giant solar flares.
Although the summit on Mount of the Holy Cross is frequently reached on a long day hike, unprepared hikers are frequently stranded or lost due to changing environmental conditions and confusion regarding the surrounding landscape, especially on the descent of North Ridge.
Thorough research and reasonable planning should prevent most tragedies.
Mount of the Holy cross is accessible from Tigiwon Road, south of Minturn, Colorado.
The Half Moon Pass Trail is the standard route to the summit of Mount of the Holy Cross via the North Ridge.
Following the Fall Creek Trail to an ascent of Notch Mountain Trail provides the best view of the Holy Cross snow feature from Notch Mountain Ridge.

These government monopolies were repealed during the Eastern Han period, and the lost revenue was recouped through heavily taxing private entrepreneurs .
The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society .
He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class .
From the reign of Emperor Wu onward, the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics, synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu .
This policy endured until the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 AD.
Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances, including papermaking , the nautical steering rudder , the use of negative numbers in mathematics , the raised-relief map , the hydraulic -powered armillary sphere for astronomy , and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum .
Some think that peer pressure and idealized body-types seen in the media are also a significant factor.
Some research show that for certain people there are genetic reasons why they may be prone to developing an eating disorder.
Recent studies have found evidence a correlation between patients with bulimia nervosa and substance use disorders .
In addition, anxiety disorders and personality disorders are common occurrences with clients of eating disorders.
While proper treatment can be highly effective for many suffering from specific types of eating disorders, the consequences of eating disorders can be severe, including death (whether from direct medical effects of disturbed eating habits or from comorbid conditions such as suicidal thinking).
Although Deepwater drilling rarely causes oil spills it is still a hazardous possible outcome.
Oil spills result in oil sinking to the bottom of the ocean smothering plant life leaving fish without food and shelter to survive.
On the other hand deepwater drilling effects the environment in a positive ways too.
In time once the deepwater oil well is not in use anymore plants will grow on and around the well making a cave or cavern like shelter ideal for animals to thrive in.
Deepwater drilling also lets us see the depths of the ocean floor that are hardly ever seen.
”Cameras on rovers at the bottom of the wells record footage and take photos of rare fish that are in there natural habitat, giving scientist a look at animals they rarely seen”(Chevron Corporation)."
Eminem has opened other ventures, including his own record label Shady Records with his manager Paul Rosenberg .
He also has his own radio channel, Shade 45 on Sirius XM Radio .
Eminem began an acting career in 2002, when he starred in the hip hop drama film 8 Mile .
He won the Academy Award for Best Original Song , becoming the first rap artist ever to win the award.
He has also made cameo appearances in The Wash (2001), Funny People (2009) and the television series Entourage .
OSS Director William Joseph "Wild Bill" Donovan demonstrated the pistol for President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House .
According to OSS research chief Stanley Lovell, Donovan (an old and trusted friend of the President) was waved into the Oval Office , where Roosevelt was dictating a letter.
While Roosevelt finished his message, Donovan turned his back and fired ten shots into a sandbag he had brought with him, announced what he had done and handed the smoking gun to the astonished president.
The British SOE ( Special Operations Executive ) Welrod assassination pistol with an integral suppressor was also used by the American OSS on clandestine operations in Nazi occupied Europe during the Second World War .
A consequence of this requirement is that there are limitations to the efficiency with which thermal energy can be converted to other kinds of energy, since thermal energy in equilibrium at a given temperature already represents the maximal evening-out of energy between all possible states.
Such energy is sometimes considered "degraded energy," because it is not entirely usable.
The second law of thermodynamics is a way of stating that, for this reason, thermal energy in a system may be converted to other kinds of energy with efficiencies approaching 100%, only if the entropy (even-ness or disorder) of the universe is increased by other means, to compensate for the decrease in entropy associated with the disappearance of the thermal energy and its entropy content.
Otherwise, only a part of thermal energy may be converted to other kinds of energy (and thus, useful work), since the remainder of the heat must be reserved to be transferred to a thermal reservoir at a lower temperature, in such a way that the increase in Entropy for this process more than compensates for the entropy decrease associated with transformation of the rest of the heat into other types of energy.
Since 2004, Japan, China, India, the United States, and the European Space Agency have each sent lunar orbiters.
These spacecraft have contributed to confirming the discovery of lunar water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and bound into the lunar regolith .
Future manned missions to the Moon have been planned, including government as well as privately funded efforts.
The Moon remains, under the Outer Space Treaty , free to all nations to explore for peaceful purposes.
This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens.
The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity.
Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region.
This allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system.
In bacteria and archaea, more than one ribosome may move along a single mRNA chain at one time, each "reading" its sequence and producing a corresponding protein molecule.
The ribosomes in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells functionally resemble many features of those in bacteria, reflecting the likely evolutionary origin of mitochondria.
Albert Claude , Christian de Duve , and George Emil Palade were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , in 1974, for the discovery of the ribosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009 was awarded to Venkatraman Ramakrishnan , Thomas A. Steitz and Ada E. Yonath for determining the detailed structure and mechanism of the ribosome.
Within weeks all the satellite states broke free from Moscow in a peaceful wave of revolutions (there was some violence in Romania ).
The pressures escalated inside the Soviet Union, where Communism fell and the USSR was formally dissolved in late 1991.
The United States remained as the world's only superpower.
The Cold War and its events have left a significant legacy, and it is often referred to in popular culture , especially in media featuring themes of espionage and the threat of nuclear warfare .
Iron oxide mixed with aluminium powder can be ignited to create a thermite reaction , used in welding and purifying ores.
It forms binary compounds with the halogens and the chalcogens .
Among its organometallic compounds is ferrocene , the first sandwich compound discovered.
Iron plays an important role in biology , forming complexes with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin ; these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates.
Iron is also the metal used at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.
On 11 February 2013, Pope Benedict announced his resignation in a speech in Latin before the cardinals, citing a "lack of strength of mind and body" due to his advanced age.
His resignation became effective on 28 February 2013.
He is the first pope to resign since Pope Gregory XII in 1415, and the first to do so on his own initiative since Pope Celestine V in 1294.
As pope emeritus, Benedict retains the style of His Holiness , and the title of Pope, and will continue to dress in the papal colour of white.
He was succeeded by Pope Francis on 13 March 2013, and he moved into the newly renovated Mater Ecclesiae monastery for his retirement on 2 May 2013..
In 1787, he returned to the merchant business with his sons Richard and Henry in Saint John, New Brunswick .
He returned to London to settle permanently in 1791, where he died ten years later.
Because of the way he changed sides, his name quickly became a in the United States for treason or betrayal.
His conflicting legacy is recalled in the ambiguous nature of some of the memorials that have been placed in his honor.
Bacon brine has added curing ingredients, most notably sodium nitrite , and occasionally sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate (saltpeter); sodium ascorbate or erythorbate are added to accelerate curing and stabilize color.
Flavorings such as brown sugar or maple are used for some products.
If used, sodium polyphosphates are added to improve sliceability and reduce spattering when the bacon is pan fried.
Today, a brine for ham, but not bacon, includes a large amount of sugar.
Historically, "ham" and "bacon" referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically, often together in the same barrel.
They carried out strong resistance to United States incursions in the decades after the American Civil War , in a series of Indian Wars , which were frequent up until the 1890s, but continued into the 20th century.
The transcontinental railroad brought more non-Natives into tribal land in the west.
Over time, the U.S. forced a series of treaties and land cessions by the tribes, and established reservations for them in many western states.
U.S. agents encouraged Native Americans to adopt European-style farming and similar pursuits, but European-American agricultural technology of the time was inadequate for often dry reservation lands.
In 1924, Native Americans who were not already U.S. citizens were granted citizenship by Congress .
Contemporary Native Americans have a unique relationship with the United States because they may be members of nations, tribes, or bands with sovereignty and treaty rights .
The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.
The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated 2012 GDP of $15.6 trillion 19% of global GDP at purchasing-power parity , as of 2011.
The per capita GDP of the U.S. was the world's sixth-highest as of 2010, although America's wealth inequality was also ranked highest among OECD countries by the World Bank .
The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure, and high productivity; and while its economy is considered post-industrial it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers.
The country accounts for 39% of global military spending , and is a leading economic, political, and cultural force in the world, as well as a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.
Nixon's second term saw an Arab oil embargo , the resignation of his vice president, Spiro Agnew , and a continuing series of revelations about the Watergate scandal and other misconduct by members of the administration.
The scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support, and on August 9, 1974, he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office.
After his resignation, he controversially received a pardon issued by his successor, Gerald Ford .
In retirement, Nixon's work as an elder statesman , authoring several books and undertaking many foreign trips, helped to rehabilitate his public image.
He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994, and died four days later at the age of 81.
In 1901, President William McKinley was assassinated and Roosevelt became President.
He attempted to move the Republican Party (GOP) toward Progressivism , including trust busting and increased regulation of businesses.
Roosevelt became the first person elected to a term in his own right in 1904 after having ascended to the Presidency (from the Vice-Presidency) upon the death of his predecessor, winning the largest percentage of the popular vote since the uncontested election of 1820 .
Roosevelt coined the phrase " Square Deal " to describe his domestic agenda, emphasizing that the average citizen would get a fair share under his policies.
As an outdoorsman and naturalist, he promoted the conservation movement .
On the world stage, Roosevelt's policies were characterized by his slogan, " Speak softly and carry a big stick ".
Both languages, along with the varieties of the Chinese language , Japanese , and Korean , are now used in elections in Alaska , California , Hawaii , Illinois , New York , Texas , and Washington .
Native American languages are spoken in smaller pockets of the country, but these populations are decreasing, and the languages are almost never widely used outside of reservations.
Hawaiian , although having few native speakers, is an official language along with English at the state level in Hawaii .
The state government of Louisiana offers services and documents in French, as does New Mexico in Spanish.
Besides English, Spanish, French, German, Navajo and other Native American languages, all other languages are usually learned from immigrant ancestors that came after the time of independence or learned through some form of education .
As the first Republican president elected after FDR, Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953–61) left the New Deal largely intact, even expanding it in some areas.
In the 1960s, Lyndon B. Johnson 's Great Society used the New Deal as inspiration for a dramatic expansion of liberal programs, which Republican Richard M. Nixon generally retained.
After 1974, however, the call for deregulation of the economy gained bipartisan support.
The New Deal regulation of banking ( Glass–Steagall Act ) was suspended in the 1990s.
Many New Deal programs remain active, with some still operating under the original names, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).
The largest programs still in existence today are the Social Security System and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Fire extinguishers are further divided into handheld and cart-mounted, also called wheeled extinguishers.
Handheld extinguishers weigh from 0.5 to 14 kilograms (1 to 30 pounds), and are hence, easily portable by hand.
Cart-mounted units typically weigh 23+ kilograms (50+ pounds).
These wheeled models are most commonly found at construction sites , airport runways , heliports , as well as docks and marinas .
Sump pump systems are also utilized in industrial and commercial applications to control water table -related problems in surface soil.
An artesian aquifer or periodic high water table situation can cause the ground to become unstable due to water saturation.
As long as the pump functions, the surface soil will remain stable.
These sumps are typically ten feet in depth or more; lined with corrugated metal pipe that contains perforations or drain holes throughout.
They may include electronic control systems with visual and audible alarms and are usually covered to prevent debris and animals from falling in.
He freed all his slaves by his final will.
Washington had a vision of a great and powerful nation that would be built on republican lines using federal power.
He sought to use the national government to preserve liberty, improve infrastructure, open the western lands, promote commerce, found a permanent capital, reduce regional tensions and promote a spirit of American nationalism.
At his death, Washington was eulogized as "first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen" by Henry Lee .
The Federalists made him the symbol of their party but for many years, the Jeffersonians continued to distrust his influence and delayed building the Washington Monument .
As the leader of the first successful revolution against a colonial empire in world history, Washington became an international icon for liberation and nationalism, especially in France and Latin America.
Haitian government estimates were higher.
The Presidential palace, Parliament and many other important structures were destroyed, along with countless homes and businesses, leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless.
The country has yet to recover from the 2010 earthquake (and subsequent incidents) due to both the severity of the damage Haiti endured in 2010, as well as a government that was ineffective well before the earthquake.
United States aid organizations have donated $2 billion.
Combined with other international donations, these funds are intended to contribute to the rebuilding of the country.
The revelations (or Ayah , lit.
"Signs [of God]") — which Muhammad reported receiving until his death – form the verses of the Quran, regarded by Muslims as the "Word of God" and around which the religion is based.
Besides the Quran, Muhammad's life ( sira ) and traditions ( sunnah ) are also upheld by Muslims as the sources of sharia law .
They discuss Muhammad and other prophets of Islam with reverence, adding the phrase peace be upon him whenever their names are mentioned.
While conceptions of Muhammad in medieval Christendom and premodern times were largely negative, appraisals in modern history have been far less so.
The honorific Mahatma ("Great Soul") was applied to him by 1914.
In India he was also called Bapu ("Father").
He is known in India as the Father of the Nation ; his birthday, 2 October, is commemorated there as Gandhi Jayanti , a national holiday , and world-wide as the International Day of Non-Violence .
Gandhi's philosophy was not theoretical but one of pragmatism, that is, practicing his principles in the moment.
Asked to give a message to the people, he would respond, "My life is my message."
And while the ruins of "The Great Stone Church" (which was all but leveled by an 1812 earthquake) are a renowned architectural wonder, the Mission is perhaps best known for the annual "Return of the Swallows" which is traditionally observed every March 19 (Saint Joseph's Day).
Mission San Juan Capistrano has served as a favorite subject for many notable artists, and has been immortalized in literature and on film numerous times, perhaps more than any other mission.
In 1984, a modern church complex was constructed just north and west of the Mission compound and is now known as Mission Basilica San Juan Capistrano .
Today, the mission compound serves as a museum, with the Serra Chapel within the compound serving as a chapel for the mission parish.
Drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive.
Forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology, energy prices, subsidies, and interest rates.
Pilot programs like EWEB's customer opt in Green Power Program show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a renewable energy source like geothermal.
But as a result of government assisted research and industry experience, the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25% over the past two decades.
In 2001, geothermal energy cost between two and ten cents per kwh.

In recent history western New Guinea was included in the Dutch East Indies colony.
The Germans annexed the northern coast of the eastern half of the island as German New Guinea in their pre–World War I effort to establish themselves as a colonial power, whilst the south eastern portion was reluctantly claimed by Britain.
Following the Treaty of Versailles , the German portion was awarded to Australia (which was already governing the British claim, named the Territory of Papua ) as a League of Nations mandate.
The eastern half of the island was granted independence from Australia as Papua New Guinea in 1975.
The western half gained independence from the Dutch in 1961, but became part of Indonesia soon afterwards in controversial circumstances.
If a leak does occur on a flat roof then damage often goes unnoticed for long periods of time during which water penetrates and soaks the decking and any insulation and/or structure beneath it.
This can lead to expensive damage from the rot which often develops and if left can weaken the roof structure.
There are also various health risks to people and animals breathing the mould spores: the severity of this health risk remains a debated point.
One problem with maintaining flat roofs is that if water does penetrate the barrier covering (be it traditional or a modern membrane) it can travel a long way before causing visible damage or leaking into a building where it can be seen.
Thus it is not easy to see where it is leaking in order to repair it.
Once underlying roof decking is soaked it often sags causing a further collection or puddling of water in that area and the problem worsens.
Its most famous product is pressure fried chicken pieces, seasoned with Sanders' "Original Recipe" of 11 herbs and spices.
The exact nature of these ingredients is unknown, and represents a notable trade secret .
Larger portions of fried chicken are served in a distinctive cardboard "bucket", which has become a signature of the chain since being introduced by franchisee Pete Harman .
KFC is famous for the slogan "finger lickin' good", which has since been replaced by "Nobody does chicken like KFC" and "So good".
The crude death rate depends on the age (and gender) specific mortality rates and the age (and gender) distribution of the population.
The number of deaths per 1000 people can be higher for developed nations than in less-developed countries, despite life expectancy being higher in developed countries due to standards of health being better.
This happens because developed countries typically have a completely different population age distribution, with a much higher proportion of older people, due to both lower recent birth rates and lower mortality rates.
A more complete picture of mortality is given by a life table which shows the mortality rate separately for each age.
A life table is necessary to give a good estimate of life expectancy .
Depending on how one calculates Chinese and other East Asian adherents, this figure might expand to include several more countries.
In addition, Buddhism is the state religion of Cambodia and Bhutan, and receives prominent mention in the constitutions of Thailand and Sri Lanka.
In northern India and Nepal, the land where Buddhism was born, the religion severely declined during the first millennium.
Whether this decline was due to the Islamic conquest of northern India, or to other factors, remains controversial.
See the article Decline of Buddhism in India .
Compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point, so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice .
Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites; notably, the ocean of Europa is believed to have over twice the water volume of Earth.
The Solar System's gas giant planets are also believed to possess liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions.
Oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons , including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone .
Ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid.
Turkey began full membership negotiations with the European Union in 2005, having been an associate member of the European Economic Community since 1963 and having joined the EU Customs Union in 1995.
Turkey has also fostered close cultural, political and economic relations with the Middle East , Caucasus , the Turkic states of Central Asia and the African countries through membership in organisations such as the Turkic Council , Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture , Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Economic Cooperation Organisation .
Turkey's growing economy and diplomatic initiatives have led to its recognition as a regional power .
Turkey is the world's 17th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 16th largest by purchasing power parity .
The planet is home to millions of species of life , including humans .
Both the mineral resources of the planet and the products of the biosphere contribute resources that are used to support a global human population .
These inhabitants are grouped into about 200 independent sovereign states , which interact through diplomacy, travel, trade, and military action.
Human cultures have developed many views of the planet, including its personification as a planetary deity , its shape as flat , its position as the center of the universe , and in the modern Gaia Principle , as a single, self-regulating organism in its own right.

He is, so far, the only president later elected to the United States House of Representatives (though John Tyler was elected to the House of Representatives of the Confederate States just before his death in 1862).
Animated by his growing revulsion against slavery , Adams became a leading opponent of the Slave Power .
He predicted that if a civil war were to break out, the president could abolish slavery by using his war powers .
Adams also predicted the Union's dissolution over the slavery issue, but said that if the South became independent there would be a series of bloody slave revolts.
The background environment is modulated by climatological cycles and patterns such as the Madden-Julian oscillation , El Niño-Southern Oscillation , and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation .
Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics.
Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere ; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an eye .
On the other end of the spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates.
It is not possible to artificially induce the dissipation of these systems with current technology.
All cavy breeds have some shared general standards: the head profile should be rounded, with large eyes and large, smooth ears.
The body should be strong and of compact build.
Coat colour should in all variations be clearly defined and thorough from root to tip.
These standards are best met by long established, commonly bred breeds, as their breeders have had enough time and animals to effectively breed for these qualities.
The coat colour ideal of good definition and thoroughness is rarely met by other than the smooth coated breeds, which have had well established, separate breeding lines for different colours.
The grain has also been stated to have higher levels of lysine than wheat.
Assuming increased acceptance, the milling industry will have to adapt to triticale, as the milling techniques employed for wheat are unsuited to triticale.
Sell et al. found triticale could be used as a feed grain , and later research found its starch was particularly readily digested.
As a feed grain, triticale is already well established and of high economic importance.
It has received attention as a potential energy crop , and research is currently being conducted on the use of the crop's biomass in bioethanol production.
His guitar playing reflected the classic blues and pentatonic scales.
He has received wide critical recognition for his guitar playing, ranking at #6 on Rolling Stones list of "100 Greatest Guitarists" in 2011.
He was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2000 and a memorial statue was erected in Austin's Auditorium Shores park.
Stevie Ray Vaughan is widely considered to be one of the greatest musicians to come from the state of Texas.
Highly distinctive, the male lion is easily recognised by its mane, and its face is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture .
Depictions have existed from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves , through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred.
It has been extensively depicted in sculptures, in paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature.
Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire , and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoos over the world since the late 18th century.
Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered Asiatic subspecies .
He also signed civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 to protect the right to vote.
He implemented desegregation of the armed forces in two years and made five appointments to the Supreme Court.
He was the first term-limited president in accordance with the 22nd Amendment .
Eisenhower's two terms were peaceful ones for the most part and saw considerable economic prosperity except for a sharp recession in 1958–59.
Eisenhower is often ranked highly among the U.S. Presidents.
On some animals, the skin is very hard and thick, and can be processed to create leather .
Reptiles and fish have hard protective scales on their skin for protection, and birds have hard feathers, all made of tough β- keratins .
Amphibian skin is not a strong barrier to passage of chemicals and is often subject to osmosis and diffusive forces.
For example, a frog sitting in an anesthetic solution would be sedated quickly, as the chemical diffuses through its skin.
Since the 1914–15 season, the Cup has been won a combined 94 times by 18 active NHL teams and five defunct teams.
Prior to that, the challenge cup was held by nine different teams.
The Montreal Canadiens have won the Cup a record 24 times and are currently the last Canadian-based team in the NHL to win the cup after winning it in 1993 .
The Stanley Cup was not awarded in 1919 because of a Spanish flu epidemic , and in 2005 , as a consequence of the NHL lockout .
He had a versatile voice and unusually wide success encompassing many genres, including country, pop ballads , gospel , and blues .
He is the best-selling solo artist in the history of popular music .
Nominated for 14 competitive Grammys , he won three, and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36.
He has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame .
In addition, the Rockabilly Hall of Fame , an online site recognizing the development of rockabilly in which Tennessee played a crucial role, is based in Nashville.
Tennessee's major industries include agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism.
Poultry , soybeans , and cattle are the state's primary agricultural products, and major manufacturing exports include chemicals, transportation equipment, and electrical equipment.
The Great Smoky Mountains National Park , the nation's most visited national park, is headquartered in the eastern part of the state, and a section of the Appalachian Trail roughly follows the Tennessee-North Carolina border.
Other major tourist attractions include the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga , the Sunsphere in Knoxville , Dollywood in Pigeon Forge , the Parthenon , the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum , and Ryman Auditorium in Nashville , and Elvis Presley's Graceland residence and tomb in Memphis.
A well-known example of an emigrant was Frank McCourt , who went to Ireland, as recounted in his book Angela's Ashes .
The memory of the Depression also shaped modern theories of economics and resulted in many changes in how the government dealt with economic downturns, such as the use of stimulus packages , Keynesian economics , and Social Security .
It also shaped modern American literature, resulting in famous novels such as John Steinbeck 's " The Grapes of Wrath " and " Of Mice and Men ".
The Great Depression of the 1930s started with the stock market crash of October 1929.
He orchestrated the realignment of voters that created the Fifth Party System .
FDR's New Deal Coalition united labor unions, big city machines, white ethnics, African Americans and rural white Southerners.
He also influenced the later creation of the United Nations and Bretton Woods .
Roosevelt is consistently rated by scholars as one of the top three U.S. Presidents , along with Abraham Lincoln and George Washington .
A liberal Democrat, Roosevelt defined his ideological position as "a little left of center."
This definition of the data warehouse focuses on data storage.
The main source of the data is cleaned, transformed, cataloged and made available for use by managers and other business professionals for data mining , online analytical processing , market research and decision support (Marakas & O'Brien 2009).
However, the means to retrieve and analyze data, to extract, transform and load data, and to manage the data dictionary are also considered essential components of a data warehousing system.
Many references to data warehousing use this broader context.
Thus, an expanded definition for data warehousing includes business intelligence tools , tools to extract, transform and load data into the repository, and tools to manage and retrieve metadata .
Also note that there are thousands of tax jurisdictions in the U.S. and many have ever-changing lists of specific types of goods and services that are not taxable.
As an illustration of the complexities: a 2006 Massachusetts law requires payment of tax on "pre-written" (not custom) software purchased and downloaded over the Internet for installation and use in Massachusetts, regardless of where it originates.
However, the actual use of the same software downloaded by a Massachusetts resident to a server in another state remains a non-taxed "service".
In contrast, Arkansas generally does not tax anything delivered over the Internet (such as downloaded software or music), except VoIP which is specifically defined as taxable "telecommunications services".
Software (pre-written or custom) "delivered thru a tangible medium" (i.e., on disk) in Arkansas is taxable even if ordered online, except "custom software for a particular customer" which is non-taxable "programming services" even if delivered on a disk.
In most cases, this complexity is part of the underlying sales tax laws; but while a brick-and-mortar store has to deal with only the sales tax laws of its own location, remote sellers have to deal with the use tax laws of many jurisdictions—up to every US state and locality that assesses them, if the company has a presence or "nexus" in every state (as large "brick-and-mortar" sellers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy do).
He used the army to build the Republican Party in the South, based on black voters, Northern newcomers (" Carpetbaggers ") and native white supporters (" Scalawags .")
As a result, African Americans were represented in the U.S. Congress for the first time in American history in 1870.
Reformers praised Grant's Indian peace policy by having broken the deadlock on Indian appropriations in Congress, the creation of the Board of Indian Commissioners to make reform recommendations, and his enlistment of Quaker Protestants who controlled mid western Indian agencies, that effectively curbed Congressional patronage.
Grant remained determined in keeping Indians from being exterminated from white settler encroachment or by the U.S. military.
Grant's reputation as president by 1875 was at an all-time high for his previous veto of the Inflation Bill, the passage of the Resumption of Specie Act, and Secretary Bristow's successful raids that shut down the Whiskey Ring .
Grant's foreign policy, led by Secretary of State Hamilton Fish , implemented International Arbitration , settled the Alabama Claims with Britain and avoided war with Spain over the Virginius Affair .
Other eponyms for scurvy include Moeller's disease and Cheadle's disease.
Scurvy does not occur in most animals because they can synthesize their own vitamin C.
However, humans and other higher primates (the simians - monkeys and apes - and tarsiers ), guinea pigs, most or all bats, and some species of birds and fish lack an enzyme ( L-gulonolactone oxidase ) necessary for such synthesis and must obtain vitamin C through their diet.
Vitamin C is widespread in plant tissues, with particularly high concentrations occurring in citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits), tomatoes, potatoes, cabbages, and green peppers.
A minority of species are social, building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals.
Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration, as in the widow spiders , to co-operative hunting and food-sharing.
Although most spiders live for at most two years, tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25 years in captivity.
While the venom of a few species is dangerous to humans, scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides .
Spider silk provides a combination of lightness, strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials, and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these can be used as silk factories.
As a result of their wide range of behaviors, spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience, cruelty and creative powers.
The number of chevrons can affect the overall outlook of a princess cut diamond.
This can usually be determined by the wire diagram that is plotted in diamond grading reports.
By adding more chevrons on the pavilion side of the diamond, the individual facets of the diamond will now be broken down into smaller facets.
As a result, it can give a princess cut diamond a "crushed ice" look.
Vice versa, when a princess cut diamond has lesser chevrons, it tends to give the diamond a chunky outlook due to broader facets.
It can help scientists understand ancient human population migrations as well as how different human groups are biologically related to one another.
For medicine, study of human genetic variation may be important because some disease-causing alleles occur more often in people from specific geographic regions.
New findings show that each human has on average 60 new mutations compared to their parents.
Apart from mutations, many genes that may have aided humans in ancient times plague humans today.
For example, it is suspected that genes that allow humans to more efficiently process food are those that make people susceptible to obesity and diabetes today.
Slaves could gain freedom only by running away (which was difficult and illegal to do), or by manumission by owners, which was regulated by states, and became increasingly difficult or prohibited.
In the earliest era of chattel slavery, the colonies also organized work by a system of bonded labor known as indentured servitude .
This typically lasted for several years for both poor Europeans and Africans alike, to pay off the costs of transport to the colonies.
They contracted for such arrangements because of poor economies in their home countries.
Between 1680 and 1700, as fewer Europeans migrated to the colonies, planters began to import more Africans as slaves.
Recognizing the importance of slavery, the House of Burgesses in Virginia enacted a new slave code in 1705; it combined a variety of legislation and added new provisions enforcing white supremacy in the law.
When calling an international number from a fixed line phone, the + must be replaced with the international call prefix chosen by the country the call is being made from.
Some mobile phones allow the + to be entered directly.
The format and allocation of local phone numbers are controlled by each nation's respective government, either directly or by sponsored organizations (such as NANPA overseen by NeuStar Inc. ).
Before a telephone call is connected, the telephone number must be dialed by the calling party or Caller.
Grant resented Sumner's superiority of manner, as well.
Told once that Sumner did not believe in the Bible, the president is supposed to have said that he was not surprised: "he didn't write it."
As the rift between Grant and Sumner increased, Sumner’s health began to decline.
When the 42nd U.S. Congress convened on March 4, 1871, Senators affiliated with President Grant, known as ‘’New Radicals’’ voted to oust Sen. Sumner from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairmanship.
Lewis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame .
In 1989, his life was chronicled in the movie Great Balls of Fire, starring Dennis Quaid.
In 2003, Rolling Stone Magazine listed his box set All Killer, No Filler: The Anthology number 242 on their list of " 500 greatest albums of all time ".
In 2004, they ranked him number 24 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.
Lewis is the last surviving member of Sun Records ' Million Dollar Quartet and the Class of '55 album, which also included Johnny Cash , Carl Perkins , Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley .
The U.S. military is one of the largest militaries in terms of number of personnel.
It draws its manpower from a large pool of paid volunteers ; although conscription has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1972.
As of 2013, the U.S. spends about $554.2 billion annually to fund its military forces, and appropriates approximately $88.5 billion to fund Overseas Contingency Operations .
Put together, the U.S. constitutes roughly 43 percent of the world's military expenditures .
The U.S. Armed Forces as a whole possess large quantities of advanced and powerful equipment, along with widespread placement of forces around the world, giving them significant capabilities in both defense and power projection .
There are people of other religious beliefs as well, giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture.
Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city.
Nepal Bhasa is the indigenous language spoken by the Newar people.
Hindi is widely understood and English is understood by Kathmandu's educated residents.
The city's literacy rate is 98%.
Kathmandu's sister cities ( Lalitpur Patan ) and Bhaktapur are integral to Kathmandu's cultural heritage, tourism industry, and economy; therefore UNESCO's World Heritage Site lists all three cities' monuments and attractions together under one heading, "Kathmandu Valley- UNESCO World Heritage Site ".
He led Britain as Prime Minister until victory over Nazi Germany had been secured.
After the Conservative Party lost the 1945 election, he became Leader of the Opposition to the Labour ( Attlee ) government.
After winning the 1951 election, he again became Prime Minister, before retiring in 1955.
Upon his death, Elizabeth II granted him the honour of a state funeral , which saw one of the largest assemblies of world statesmen in history.
Named the Greatest Briton of all time in a 2002 poll, Churchill is widely regarded as being among the most influential people in British history.
The defending Confederate army failed, leading to Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865.
The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars .
Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively.
The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed World War I .
It remains the deadliest war in American history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties.
Historian John Huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40.
Some of these fabrics, woven from hand spun yarns, were very fine for their day, but are coarse compared to modern linen.
Today, linen is usually an expensive textile, and is produced in relatively small quantities.
It has a long "staple" (individual fiber length) relative to cotton and other natural fibers .
Many products are made of linen: aprons, bags, towels (swimmers, bath, beach, body and wash towels), napkins, bed linens, linen tablecloths, runners, chair covers, and men's & women's wear.
In this model, the electrons were free to rotate within the blob or cloud of positive substance.
These orbits were stabilized in the model by the fact that when an electron moved farther from the center of the positive cloud, it felt a larger net positive inward force, because there was more material of opposite charge, inside its orbit (see Gauss's law ).
In Thomson's model, electrons were free to rotate in rings which were further stabilized by interactions between the electrons, and spectra were to be accounted for by energy differences of different ring orbits.
Thomson attempted to make his model account for some of the major spectral lines known for some elements, but was not notably successful at this.
Still, Thomson's model (along with a similar Saturnian ring model for atomic electrons , also put forward in 1904 by Nagaoka after James Clerk Maxwell 's model of Saturn's rings ), were earlier harbingers of the later and more successful solar-system-like Bohr model of the atom.
The great powers that were the victors of the war—the United States, the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and France—became the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council .
The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War , which lasted for the next 46 years.
Meanwhile, the influence of European great powers started to decline, while the decolonisation of Asia and Africa began.
Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery .
Political integration, especially in Europe , emerged as an effort to stabilise postwar relations and fight more effectively in the Cold War.
With sales flattening to 100,000 cases by 1929, Anheuser-Busch stopped production.
The Bevo Mill , St. Louis, in 2008
The Bevo building, with the Renard character prominently displayed at the corners, still operates as a bottling facility at their main brewery in St. Louis, Missouri .
The landmark Bevo Mill , constructed by August Anheuser Busch, Sr. in 1917.
It was closed in 2009, but it reopened in October 2009 under new owners.
Bevo is also mentioned in the short story " The Killers " by Ernest Hemingway ; as well as in Babbitt by Sinclair Lewis .
Following the decline of Rome and its industrial-scale wine production for export, the Christian Church in medieval Europe also became a firm supporter of wine, necessary for celebration of the Catholic Mass. Whereas wine was forbidden in medieval Islamic cultures, its use in Christian libation was widely tolerated.
Geber and other Muslim chemists pioneered the distillation of wine for Islamic medicinal and industrial purposes such as perfume .
Wine production gradually increased, with consumption burgeoning from the 15th century onwards.
Wine production survived the devastating Phylloxera louse of 1887 and eventually spread to numerous regions throughout the world.
After the recombined maternal and paternal homologs have separated into the two daughter cells, a second round of cell division occurs.
There meiosis ends as the two sister chromatids making up each homolog are separated and move into one of the four resulting gamete cells.
Upon fertilization , for example when a sperm enters an egg cell, two gamete cells produced by meiosis fuse.
The gamete from the mother and the gamete from the father each contribute one half of the set of chromosomes that make up the new offspring's genome .
Meiosis uses many of the same mechanisms as mitosis , a type of cell division used by eukaryotes like plants and animals to split one cell into two identical daughter cells.
In all plants and in many protists meiosis results in the formation of spores : haploid cells that can divide vegetatively without undergoing fertilization.
This is demonstrated by the "zero-g" conditions inside a freely falling elevator falling toward the Earth's center (in vacuum), or (to good approximation) conditions inside a spacecraft in Earth orbit.
These are examples of coordinate acceleration (a change in velocity) without a sensation of weight.
The experience of no g-force (zero-g), however it is produced, is synonymous with weightlessness .
In the absence of gravitational fields, or in directions at right angles to them, proper and coordinate accelerations are the same, and any coordinate acceleration must be produced by a corresponding g-force acceleration.
An example here is a rocket in free space, in which simple changes in velocity are produced by the engines, and produce g-forces on the rocket and passengers.
The lingual groove runs from the more distal of the central pits in the central groove toward the lingual surface between the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps.
The buccal groove runs from the more mesial of the central pits in the central groove toward the buccal surface between the mesiobuccal and distobuccal cusps ending in the buccal pit.
The portion of the central groove between the central pits is termed the Lewis offset and is mandatory to account for the locations of the buccal and lingual grooves (buccal groove being more mesial than the lingual groove while they are parallel).
From the buccal (buccal view), two roots are present.
The distal root is generally straighter, although both often have a slight distal curvature.
The heights of contour on the mesial and distal contact the adjacent teeth and are located at the junction of the occlusal and middle thirds of the crown.
He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence meant he often spent years on the development and production of a picture.
His films are characterised by slapstick combined with pathos , and often feature the Tramp struggling against adversity.
Many contain social and political themes, as well as autobiographical elements.
In 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his work, Chaplin received an Honorary Academy Award for "the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century".
He continues to be held in high regard, with The Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times, and The Great Dictator often ranked among the greatest films of all time.
However, the state also opposed and used its security forces against those armed groups - principally the Provisional Irish Republican Army , who tried to unite Ireland by force.
This occurred in the 1950s, throughout the 1970s and 1980s and has continued on a reduced scale.
Irish governments meanwhile tried to broker an agreement to the conflict known as The Troubles within Northern Ireland from 1968 to the late 1990s.
The British government officially recognised the right of the Irish government to be a party to the Northern negotiations in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985.
In 1998, as part of the Good Friday Agreement , the Irish constitution was altered by referendum to remove the territorial claim to Northern Ireland and instead extend the right of Irish citizenship to all the people of the island should they wish to have it.
This amounts to 20%, the same as per Netter's Atlas.
Interstitial fluid (4/5 of extracellular fluid)
Transcellular fluid (a.k.a. "third space," normally ignored in calculations)
Contained inside organs, such as the gastrointestinal , cerebrospinal , peritoneal, and ocular fluids.
For example, folic acid may carry methyl , formyl , and methylene groups in the cell.
Although these roles in assisting enzyme-substrate reactions are vitamins' best-known function, the other vitamin functions are equally important.
Until the mid-1930s, when the first commercial yeast-extract vitamin B complex and semi-synthetic vitamin C supplement tablets were sold, vitamins were obtained solely through food intake, and changes in diet (which, for example, could occur during a particular growing season) usually greatly altered the types and amounts of vitamins ingested.
However, vitamins have been produced as commodity chemicals and made widely available as inexpensive semisynthetic and synthetic-source multivitamin dietary and food supplements and additives, since the middle of the 20th century.
With the conveniences stamps offered, their use resulted in greatly increased mailings during the 19th and 20th centuries.
Postage stamps during this era were the most popular way of paying for mail, but by the end of the 20th century were rapidly being eclipsed by the use of metered postage and bulk mailing by businesses.)
The same result with respect to communications by private parties occurred over the last decade of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st due to declining cost of long distance telephone communications and the development and explosive spread of electronic mailing ("e-mail" via the Internet) and bill paying systems had.
As postage stamps with their engraved imagery began to appear on a widespread basis, historians and collectors began to take notice.
The study of postage stamps and their use is referred to as philately .
Stamp collecting can be both a hobby and a form of historical study and reference, as government-issued postage stamps and their mailing systems have always been involved with the history of nations.
Jordan and Pippen are members of the Chicago Bulls team who won three consecutive championships twice in the 1990s.
Robert Horry and John Salley are the only players to have won the championships with three different teams.
Horry won seven championships with the Houston Rockets , the Los Angeles Lakers and the San Antonio Spurs , while Salley won four championships with the Detroit Pistons , the Bulls and the Lakers.
Frank Saul and Steve Kerr are the only players to win two championships with two different teams in consecutive seasons.
Saul won consecutive championships with the Rochester Royals and the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1950s, while Kerr won consecutive championships with the Bulls and the Spurs in the 1990s,
From March to October 2012, the Imagination Movers toured North America on their post-Disney "Rock-O-Matic" tour.
The show maintained several elements of the original TV concept, such as an on-stage "idea emergency" and several sets from their older catalogue; however, with the departure of Wendy Calio back to her native Hawaii, the character "Nina", along with her musical numbers, is not present.
The tour promotes the Imagination Movers' new album/DVD release, "Rock-O-Matic", which features all new music from the band.
The album itself is produced independently of Disney and has a notably more mature, contemporary rock-and-roll sound, though still very appropriate for children.
Several performance dates were moved to later in 2012 to benefit from the increased exposure of the Imagination Movers TV show now playing daily on Disney Junior.
The reduced-pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into the boiler.
In general usage, the term steam engine can refer to either the integrated steam plants (including boilers etc.) such as railway steam locomotives and portable engines , or may refer to the piston or turbine machinery alone, as in the beam engine and stationary steam engine .
Specialized devices such as steam hammers and steam pile drivers are dependent on steam supplied from a separate boiler .
A mill engine from Stott Park Bobbin Mill , Cumbria, England
A steam locomotive in Germany .This class of engine was built in 1942 – 1950 and operated commercially until 1988.
The LCD screen is more energy efficient and can be disposed of more safely than a CRT.
Its low electrical power consumption enables it to be used in battery -powered electronic equipment.
It is an electronically modulated optical device made up of any number of segments filled with liquid crystals and arrayed in front of a light source ( backlight ) or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome .
Liquid crystals were first discovered in 1888.
By 2008, worldwide sales of televisions with LCD screens exceeded annual sales of CRT units; the CRT became obsolete for most purposes.
Over the following years, plans for a rebuilt World Trade Center took form.
The first new building at the site was 7 World Trade Center, which opened in .
The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC), established in to oversee the rebuilding process, organized competitions to select a site plan and memorial design.
Memory Foundations , designed by Daniel Libeskind , was selected as the master plan, but this went through substantial changes in design.
The new World Trade Center complex will include One World Trade Center , three other high-rise office towers, and the National September 11 Memorial & Museum .
In 1989, the first of many video game and computer game editions was published.
Since 1994, many official variants of the game, based on locations other than Atlantic City , New Jersey (the official U.S. setting) or London (the official Commonwealth setting, excepting Canada), have been published by Hasbro or its licensees.
In 2008, Hasbro permanently changed the color scheme and some of the gameplay of the standard U.S. Edition of the game to match the UK Edition, although the U.S. standard edition maintains the Atlantic City property names.
Hasbro also modified the official logo to give the "Mr. Monopoly" character a 3-D computer-generated look, which has since been adopted by licensees USAopoly , Winning Moves and Winning Solutions .
And Hasbro has also been including the Speed Die, introduced in 2006's Monopoly: The Mega Edition by Winning Moves Games, in versions produced directly by Hasbro (such as the 2009 Championship Edition).
The near instantaneous rush of surface charges, induced by the overhead thundercloud itself, race to the strike point from hundreds to thousands of feet away during discharge.
This current, caused during each stroke, takes the path of least resistance, which may be ion rich human or animal legs, over poorly conducting earth.
This is why it is best to crouch, with feet close together, if ever caught in the open during a thunderstorm.
Unfortunately, most reports do not draw a distinction between the real cause of injury or death, be it the strike itself, a resulting explosion or fire, or usually responsible step potential.
On Friday, July 9, 2010, the U.S. Justice Department opened a civil rights case against Mehserle; the federal government can prosecute him independently for the same act under the separate sovereigns exception to double jeopardy .
The Department of Justice will be working with the U.S. Attorney 's office in San Francisco and the FBI .
On November 5, 2010, Mehserle was sentenced to two years, minus time served.
He served his time in the Los Angeles County Jail, occupying a private cell away from other prisoners.
He was released on June 13, 2011 and is now on parole.
The long storage life of some cheese, especially if it is encased in a protective rind, allows selling when markets are favorable.
Additional ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black peppers , garlic , chives or cranberries .
A specialist seller of cheese is sometimes known as a cheesemonger.
To become an expert in this field, like wine or cooking, requires some formal education and years of tasting and hands-on experience.
This position is typically responsible for all aspects of the cheese inventory; selecting the cheese menu, purchasing, receiving, storage, and ripening.
The decision is acknowledged for the influential role it played in altering the national political landscape: it is credited with launching Abraham Lincoln’s national political career and ultimately allowing for his election.
Although the Supreme Court has never explicitly overruled the Dred Scott case, the Court stated in the Slaughter-House Cases that at least one part of it had already been overruled by the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, which begins by stating, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."
To which the Court noted:
The first observation we have to make on this clause is, that it puts at rest both the questions which we stated to have been the subject of differences of opinion.
It declares that persons may be citizens of the United States without regard to their citizenship of a particular State, and it overturns the Dred Scott decision by making all persons born within the United States and subject to its jurisdiction citizens of the United States.
The landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education made the desegregation of elementary and high schools a national priority, while the Pell Grant program helped poor minorities gain access to college.
Special education was made into federal law in 1975.
The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 made standardized testing a requirement, and in 1983, a commission was established to evaluate their results and propose a course of action.
The resulting No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 was controversial and its goals proved to be unrealistic.
A commission established in 2006 evaluated higher education , but its recommendations have yet to be fully implemented.
On medical leave for most of 2011, Jobs resigned in August that year, and was elected Chairman of the Board.
He died of respiratory arrest related to his metastatic tumor on October 5, 2011.
Jobs received a number of honors and public recognition for his influence in the technology and music industries.
He has been referred to as "legendary", a "futurist" or simply "visionary", and has been described as the "Father of the Digital Revolution", a "master of innovation", and a "design perfectionist".
Some of Khrushchev's policies were seen as erratic, particularly by his emerging rivals, who quietly rose in strength and deposed him in October 1964.
He did not suffer the deadly fate of some previous losers of Soviet power struggles, but was pensioned off with an apartment in Moscow and a dacha in the countryside.
His lengthy memoirs were smuggled to the West and published in part in 1970.
