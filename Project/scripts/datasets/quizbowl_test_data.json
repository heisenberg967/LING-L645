This philosopher was inspired by Hermetic doctrines to reject Aristotelian accounts of motion in his book Cause, Principle and Unity, which also provided a pantheist account of the universe.

In England, this idea was promoted by Thomas Taylor in his book Two Covenants of God with Mankind. Gottfried Leibniz rejected this stance and instead relied on \"pre-established harmony,\" though Antoine Arnauld argued it isindistinguishable from this view.
