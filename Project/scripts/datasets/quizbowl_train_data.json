Bruce Hoffman is an expert on this practice, which is paired with \"humanism\" in a book that discusses Marxist (*) revolutions by Maurice Merleau-Ponty.

For 10 points, name this theory that decreasing disorder will reduce crime.", "In one work, this thinker argues that two sets of virtues drive market action - \"commercial sydrome\" and \"guardian syndrome\" - one promotes honest collaboration and one does not, but in combination the systems form a \"monstrous hybrid.\" Another work elucidates the three \"transactions of decline\" including military production, subsidies to poor regions, and advanced-backward trade. This thinker used the example of Japan developing bicycle repair shops in the late 1800s, which led the country to eventually produce its own bicycles, to demonstrate the idea of \"import replacement.\" In addition to Systems of Survival, this author defended pursuing the sovereignty of Quebec in The Question of Separatism. This longtime opponent of Robert Moses described the \"ballet of the sidewalks\" in New York in arguing for mixed-use neighborhoods. For 10 points, name this urban studies pioneer and author of The Death and Life of Great American Cities.", "A relaxed set of postulates for this framework is the Mas-Colell axioms, which eliminate the need for transitivity. In systems governed by this model, the set of excess demand functions is not restricted by the usual rationality restrictions on individual demands in the economy, a result known as the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu theorem. One argument for this theory considers an auction in which each agent calculates his demand for a good at every possible price and submits it to an auctioneer, from which a price in agreement with this theory will be computed. The production function usually used in this theory is due to Koopmans, although it was significantly refined by another economist in The Theory of Value. This theory's central tenet is that excess market demand always sums to zero. For 10 points, identify this theory of economics that claims that all markets and prices are always at a macroeconomic optimum.", "One unorthodox proposed method for dealing with it involves massive foreign currency purchases. Eggertson and Woodford argue that for open-market operations to be effective in this situation requires changing future expectations of policy. Consequently, one approach for dealing with it has been written about by Lars Svenson and involves an explicit central bank commitment to a future price level, also known as nominal GDP targeting. Another method for dealing with this problem is when the Treasury agrees to broaden its asset purchases, termed \"quantitative easing.\" Paul Krugman has written about Japan's experience in this state, and has argued that the recent economic crisis is an instance of it. Occurring when consumers' preference for cash is greater than the supply of money, FTP, identify this macroeconomist state in which low or zero interest rates fail to stimulate consumer spending.", "One of his last works was written with Faye Duchin, and discussed what effect machines would have in displacing unskilled labor. In addition to writing The Future Impact of Automation on Workers, he also wrote an article on \"The Pure Theory of the Guaranteed Annual Wage Contract.\" This man utilized his best known idea in a plot of the \"Structure of World Production,\" and he formulated that idea in The Structure of American Industry. His best known technique uses a table to chart the flow of money between various industries, while he noted that the U.S. exports labor-intensive goods instead of capital-intensive goods. For 10 points, identify this economist who developed input-output analysis, in addition to elucidating a namesake paradox.", "His doctoral dissertation concerned the substitution between Labor and Capital in U.S. Manufacturing. One of his articles introduced a model in which all individuals can only observe aggregated price changes, a set up which means that they cannot make the right decisions about changing production levels. A related concept to that Islands model is this man's namesake critique which claims that any economic relationships that appear to hold in the real world may become invalid as a response to active fiscal or monetary policy. For 10 points, identify this Chicago economist whose paradox concerns why more capital is not flowing from developed to developing nations, a 1995 Nobelist better known for expounding the neutrality of money and rational expectations.", "This economist argued that countries should avoid deflation even if it causes their currency to depreciate in A Tract on Monetary Reform.

For 10 points, name this British economist who wrote General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money and advocated governmental intervention in the economy.", "This must decrease as rival firms' aggregate output increases in order for Cournot competition to hold, and if a strictly positive subsistence level is introduced to a CES function, this quantity becomes non-monotonic. It is given by price times the quantity 1 minus 1 over demand elasticity, showing that its sign is an indicator of elasticity. In oligopolies, this curve has a jump due to the kinked demand curve, and in monopolies, a deadweight loss is caused because this curve, and not demand, determines quantity sold. For 10 points, name this curve that generally marks equilibrium where it meets marginal cost, and which measures the added revenue of an additional unit sold.", "Generally, output shocks cause this quantity to move in the same direction as deflated stock prices, but move in opposite ways from normal stock prices. Serletis treats variations in it as being a random walk, and Keynes notably believed this quantity was unstable, changing with the interest rate. It may be determined nationally as the ratio between the GDP and the money supply, while Irving Fisher believed it is stable and independent of the other variables in his quantity theory of money, where it can be given by his equation of exchange as \"PT over M.\" For 10 points, give this term denoting how often a unit of money is spent over a time interval.", "They may cease to exist in a Markowitz model, although rational actors can introduce them in more complicated scenarios. When they are injected into the Slutsky Equation, the result is a uniquely negative semidefinite symmetry. Alfred Marshall devoted approximately ten lines of his Principles of Economics to them originally, and Uriel Spingel argued that public transportation was one. They clearly differ from the Veblen type, which factor in conspicuous consumption, and two Harvard economists have made the case for rice and noodles being ones in parts of China. FTP, name these theoretical inferior goods most famously exemplified by potatoes during the Irish potato famine.", "Grossman and Hart have suggested that failure of some corporate takeovers may be due to this behavior that, according to Ronald Coase, can be reduced by lowering transaction costs to near zero. In a 1968 essay, Garrett Hardin discounted the possibility of natural altruism and argued that, in the context of positive externalities, laissez faire policies inevitably lead to it. The tit-for-tat approach may be appropriate for one analog, the iterated prisoner's dilemma, but the concept of a public good leads to a tragedy of the commons in a more general situation. FTP, name this economic problem in which actors avoid paying for goods that cannot be taken away.", "The first English author to discuss it specifically may have been John Hales, in his A Discourse on the Commonweal of this Realm of England, though in the 19th century H. D. Macleod named it for a contemporary of Hales.  Later in the 19th century Robert Giffen argued that its namesake didn't understand the importance of bimetallism, while William Stanley Jevons claimed, on its basis, that Herbert Spencer's arguments about private coinage were flawed.  Its namesake enunciated this principle in the 16th century in response to the \"Great Debasements\" introduced by the predecessors to Queen Elizabeth.  FTP, name this principle which states that bad money drives good money out of circulation.", "Using Beveridge-Nelson or Hodrick-Prescott decomposition, it can be applied to business cycles. Due to its static nature and lack of causality, it is often replaced by the more dynamic model of Martin Zagler. Other variations on it include a Vector Autoregression approach by Blanchard, and one which included expectational variables by Milton Friedman, who has also related it to the Philips Curve. It implies that an increase in labor productivity will cause \"jobless growth,\" and according to its formulator its factor \"a\" is approximately .3.  FTP, identify this economic law that describes the relationship between unemployment and the GNP gap, named for an American economist whose first name is Arthur.", "He argued for the \"need for a sociology and psychology of social science and scientists\" in an essay collected in his late volume Against the Grain.  His early theoretical work includes lectures, collected under the title Monetary Equilibrium, that distinguished between ex ante and ex post investment. Later he rejected  the neoclassical school in favor of institutional studies, illustrating his pessimistic Malthusian view of developmental economics with an \"inquiry into the poverty of nations\" entitled Asian Drama.

FTP name this Stockholm School economist, author of An American Dilemma and co-winner of the Nobel Prize with Friedrich von Hayek.", "He attempted to rework Sidgwick's philosophy from the perspective of Fechner's psychophysics in his first book, New and Old Methods of Ethics.  His major book wasn't much noticed until the 1950s, when Shubik and Scarf took up his notion of \"final settlements\" in their work on game theory.  Two years after publishing that major book, he shifted gears and devoted himself to mathematical statistics, which led to his becoming the first editor of the Economic Journal.  The concepts of offer, contract, and indifference curves were all introduced by him, as was the general utility function, and he anticipated the Pareto optimum in 1881's Mathematical Psychics.  FTP, name this student of Jevons, a British economist best known for his eponymous box.", "A 1948 study by Patinkin points out that one of the results of this occurrence may be offset by the Haberler-Pigou effect, resolving a certain paradox surrounding instant price reduction. It may be resolved via the Svensson or Krugman methods, while Global Taylor rules may produce it when combined with the zero bound rate. Public depreciation announcements and inflation targeting are two of its popular solutions. An increase in government spending has a full multiplier effect on the equilibrium income level in this case in which the IS curve intersects a horizontal LM curve, though cutting interest rates fails to produce change in unemployment or demand. FTP, what is this scenario characterized by consumer preference for mobile hard currency?", "It must have a positive slope, and because the factor it measures cannot be negative it must be concave up and cannot rise above the line y = x, known as the line of perfect equality.  The area between it and the line of perfect equality is known as the Gini coefficient, and at each point its y-value shows the cumulative percentage of a given asset owned by the bottom x percent of the sample.  First developed by its namesake American economist during the early-20th century, FTP, identify this construct from welfare economics used to illustrate income inequality.", "Georgescu-Roegen criticized this as merely being an exercise in math, citing as an example a paper that assumed more traders than there are real numbers.  The Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu theorem states that demand functions in these models can have arbitrary shapes. Arrow and Debreu introduced the modern \"neo-Walrasian\" ideas of how to build them.  These models posit that every goods market is embedded in a larger economy and so the supply and demand curves affect each other.  For 10 points - identify this branch of microeconomics concerned with determining levels of production, consumption, and prices for all commodities in an economy simultaneously.", "A strong nation, according to theory, was to have a large population, which would provide a supply of labor, a market, and soldiers.

Its commercial importance was related to Hasan Dag, a nearby volcano and the source of obsidian. Plastered auroch skulls and other objects decorated by horns are taken as evidence of an important bull cult here, though since the discovery of an obese female statue with two leopards by Melaart, this site has been associated with goddess worship.
